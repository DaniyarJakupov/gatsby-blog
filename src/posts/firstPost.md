# Welcome, stranger!

Finally, I've found some time to play around with Gatsby. It's been a long time coming, but hey, better late than never, amirite?

So far I like what I see. Really nice abstraction layer around graphql and routing, reach ecosystem with a bunch of super useful plugins including such gems as image-processing, markdown support, etc.

So yeah, I'll definitely keep exploring Gatsby.js!
